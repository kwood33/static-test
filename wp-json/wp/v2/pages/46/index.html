Boredom and decay.<\/p>\n<p>I\u00a0speak for\u00a0the subtle aspects of our hearts and souls we&#8217;ve forgotten, yet yearn for.<\/p>\n<p>I speak for the great mother we all share, and how to return to the sacred.<\/p>\n<p>I speak for the lost and confused, and those who exist in pieces, because you are full in your brokenness.<\/p>\n<p>If this resonates, <a href=\"http:\/\/kevinjameswood.com\/free-book\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">then I ask you to join me<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>My creative lineage is steeped in the ancient philosophers, poets, and sages of times past. I write because I can&#8217;t not write.<\/p>\n<p>I write because I don&#8217;t know what else to do. When I don&#8217;t write a small piece of me starts to die\u00a0&#8211; I\u00a0become malnourished, and it&#8217;s not a pretty sight.<\/p>\n<p>When I do write, I start to love life again. The tap to my universal happiness faucet begins to flow. The world is usually a better place when I write, at least my inner world.<\/p>\n<p>And this makes me a more useful poet to you.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/kevinjameswood.com\/my-story\">Read the long version of my story<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Below you&#8217;ll find\u00a0my (un)professional bio:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>I like to me the dumbest person in the room (not that hard).<\/li>\n<li>Rules scare me, and I resist them (usually subconsciously).<\/li>\n<li>I believe writing from your heart is better than any system or formula.<\/li>\n<li><del datetime=\"2016-03-24T22:15:43+00:00\">I\u2019ve lived a nomadic lifestyle for the past five years<\/del> (Currently based out of Truckee, CA).<\/li>\n<li>I struggle to write everyday, even though it&#8217;s the only thing that breathes life into me.<\/li>\n<li>I still struggle daily to get my ass into gear and get my work done.<\/li>\n<li>I beat myself up about my writing on an almost daily basis, although I\u2019m slowly learning to love myself more.<\/li>\n<li>I\u2019m not perfect (super duper far from it).<\/li>\n<li>I&#8217;m a mess of contradictions (yay for being human).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you still want to read what I write, then I send you my blessings and eternal gratitude.<\/p>\n<p>Still here?
