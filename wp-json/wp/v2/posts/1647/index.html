When you take off your own veil and step out of the collective illusion, you provide deep support for others willing (or too afraid) to do the same.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Be brilliant. Let the power of choice direct your life. The freedom that comes from taking responsibility for your own life comes packed with uncertainty and doubt, but the taste of greater possibility outweighs the slight queasiness.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Choose to step into your power.

The current that runs beneath your life will allow more beauty to come to the forefront. It&#8217;s as if a godlike wind is directing your sails.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Blaze your path.
