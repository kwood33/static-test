Timely for this post, living in my very own groundhog day.<\/p>\n<p>However, there&#8217;s been a crucial part to not having a routine that&#8217;s been a very large detriment to my creative output and general progress towards my goals. The first is the energy you create around something when you work on it at the same time everyday.<\/p>\n<p>The daily creation, even if it&#8217;s small helps you build. For someone taking on <a href=\"http:\/\/kevinjameswood.com\/projects\">several self-directed large scale projects this year<\/a> the stuff you do daily really adds up. Second, when you start a new routine it&#8217;s going to suck until it&#8217;s a habit.<\/p>\n<p>However, there&#8217;s a certain beauty when habits start to come\u00a0into play. It then requires way less effort to do the same thing you&#8217;ve been doing. This helps you build up energy reserves. Instead of having to flex your willpower muscle every time you want to do something.<\/p>\n<p>It becomes an ingrained part of you. Hopefully, the habit is positive.<\/p>\n<p>Right now I&#8217;m letting routine force it&#8217;s way into my rambling life for the first time in a very long-time. My general fear of routine has caused me to see past the positive elements it can bring into my life.<\/p>\n<p>After all, we need to do what we&#8217;re afraid to do, and for me that means\u00a0instigating a set of creative habits to help me accomplish what I want to accomplish this year.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s to the same ol&#8217;, same ol&#8217;.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Often the fears holding us\u00a0back aren&#8217;t the ones we think.
