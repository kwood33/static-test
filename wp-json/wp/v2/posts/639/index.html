The pages were bent, the metal spine could barely hold the pages. The lines were drooping from a minor water spill.<\/p>\n<p>I had to lick the pen. The ink was so dry. The pen was cracked.

Weary lines that were waiting for me. Time to meet my new best friend.<\/p>\n<p>It\u00a0didn&#8217;t care what I said. It\u00a0didn&#8217;t critique my shitty poetry. It\u00a0didn&#8217;t tell my lies, my secrets, and my visions to anyone. I didn&#8217;t have it in me to share it at the time.<\/p>\n<p>Little did I know those first lines would be the start of my entire life.<\/p>\n<p>It was here I found myself, the beginning of my truth, the first steps of my\u00a0journey.<\/p>\n<p>The first few moments were awful. I thought all the years of English class might do something to improve my sentence structure, or maybe my creativity. I was wrong.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t remember what the first sentence said. But, I bet it was horrible. Everything we do for the first time is the worst thing imaginable.<\/p>\n<p>If I was dead at the time it would make me roll over in my grave.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not important how bad we are when we start. It&#8217;s important we trust ourselves enough to take the first step, no matter how small it may be. Start walking my friend.<\/p>\n<p>For five years I never showed my work. I filled up journals, I hid them under my bed, and I threw them away.<\/p>\n<p>No matter the content held within the spine, each journal saw its demise. I was writing as if I was concealing a secret. Exposing a part of myself the world wasn&#8217;t ready for, yet.<\/p>\n<p>Through the gates of the pages I saw more of myself than I wanted to see. I felt something more real than my waking reality. I found something that was worth protecting.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not here to tell you that writing has solved all of my problems, far from it.<\/p>\n<p>But it has acted as a gateway for exploration, both into the world and into myself. The most valuable thread in the entire universe.<\/p>\n<p>Without this I become lost. Or more likely, I get caught up. Without examination, disconnection and exploration I become tethered to the very things I&#8217;m trying to run away from.<\/p>\n<p>Writing helps me to cultivate mindfulness. What usually comes out are the lessons I need to learn and pay attention to. So often, what we write for others ends up having the most impact on ourselves.<\/p>\n<p>With that I raise a toast to shitty writing. Without you I&#8217;d be lost.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I opened up an old spiraled notebook.
