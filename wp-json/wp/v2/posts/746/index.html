Once you crack the pages the words\u00a0begin to work.<\/p>\n<p>Like the magical compound psilocybin, the words begin to work on your perspective of self and the world you&#8217;re immersed in. The moment you close the spine for good\u00a0you&#8217;re perspective is just a little bit wider.<\/p>\n<p>No need to go back and review the words. No need to remind yourself of the exercises.<\/p>\n<p>You are different. You have grown.<\/p>\n<p>Some books are more gentle than others. Some stories rip you open and expose your heart to the world before you&#8217;re ready. They force you to heal and come face to face with your shadows.<\/p>\n<p>Others gently nudge you into wholeness. Like a soft push from a lover.<\/p>\n<p>Regardless of the process, the words change you.<\/p>\n<p>We can build a new world from the words that\u00a0stem from the very fabric of our being.<\/p>\n<p>Words only ring true when they come from a deeper source. A place of truth. Only when saturated in honesty and utter reality can a book have this psychoactive power.<\/p>\n<p>Words with depth. Stories with openness. Sentences, whose pauses touch the very essence of our soul.<\/p>\n<p>We crave depth in a world gone flat. Not just scientific depth, a pursuit of more knowledge, but instead depth that encompasses the entire\u00a0spectrum. We want depth that arises from the whispers of our heart.<\/p>\n<p>The yearnings we translate into words that sprawl across a digital or paper canvas.<\/p>\n<p>These are the books of the new world.<\/p>\n<p>Together we are creating a new story. A story of freedom, love, compassion, appreciation and connection.<\/p>\n<p>Time to step into truth.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Words can act on their own to effectively alter reality.
