The type of healing I want to talk about is more of a return and union than anything else.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s about acceptance, self-reflection, energetic processing and stepping into wholeness. As a culture (I&#8217;m talking about the <em>modern<\/em> West) we have this idea ingrained into the depths of our consciousness that we are separate beings in a wholly mechanical universe.<\/p>\n<p>This mindset and associated beliefs are outdated. They don&#8217;t provide the full truth of the world we&#8217;re inhabiting. We living life as if we have all the answers.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of sitting and living with unanswered questions and unknowns, we assume we know how the world operates because <em>that&#8217;s how it always been<\/em>. Instead of seeking out new beliefs and mindsets that will empower us in living in and creating a new world.<\/p>\n<p>However, before we can get to the point of structuring a new personal universe. We must start with the dark spots in our own lives.<\/p>\n<p>We must illuminate the dark to step more fully into the light.<\/p>\n<p>Often, the embodiment of our darkness tends to be our greatest ally. The times of greatest darkness in my own life eventually ended up bringing more light my way.<\/p>\n<p>When I came out of a period of deep depression I was given the gifts of compassion, self-reliance and a little more lust for life.<\/p>\n<p>When I went through a long period of grief following the loss of my father, I was given immense gifts I&#8217;m still trying to integrate today.<\/p>\n<p>Those dark times carved the path for greater light to show up in my life. At the time I would have given anything to be out of the dark times forever, but looking back I can give a certain amount of meaning to those experiences.<\/p>\n<p>After all, that&#8217;s all they are anyway is an experience. We label them good or bad, but those labels never really touch the truth of the event. They help us to contextualize and compartmentalize, but those very same labels can distance us from the reality we&#8217;re dying to experience.<\/p>\n<p>The core of healing is all about honesty.<\/p>\n<p>Honesty is rare. Telling lies is easy.<\/p>\n<p>The core of healing is listening to the lies you tell yourself. It&#8217;s exploring the experiences you&#8217;d rather not admit happened to you. It&#8217;s dealing with your own bullshit, your sadness and fears, and bringing them into the light where they can be given space to breathe.<\/p>\n<p>Healing is about living from a point of wholeness, rather than the need to be fixed.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What does self-healing even mean?
