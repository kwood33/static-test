Other times it comes more naturally, in moments of transcendence. These are the best. <em>Effortless freedom<\/em>. When reality cracks at the foundation to reveal something deeper and more pure.<\/p>\n<p>The moonlight sonata of chaos also brings the subtle tones of peace and beauty. This ride is the ride we all hope for. To walk\u00a0towards\u00a0something resembling freedom.<\/p>\n<p><!--more-->Just a single moment. Free from the prisons we impose on ourselves.<\/p>\n<p>We lose our inner freedom the moment we let the external come crashing down and\u00a0throw off the balance we\u2019ve worked so hard to cultivate. The seeds we\u2019ve planted go to waste, but not for long. When we regain our composure we begin to test our adaptability. Learning\u00a0to work into freedom, and how\u00a0to keep the channels open to let it assume its own natural state.<\/p>\n<p>The state of wild.<\/p>\n<p>The state of wandering.<\/p>\n<p>The state of constant flux.<\/p>\n<p>True freedom will never be found in comfort, it will only be found in embracing the utter chaos of existence. It springs from learning to ride the wave, instead of trying to engineer the perfect wave to ride.<\/p>\n<p>Being okay with the unknown.<\/p>\n<p>Being able to find the line of truth within a world forcing us to conform into a certain box. The box of a well-constructed human.<\/p>\n<p>Beyond the edges we find the true wild nature of our soul.<\/p>\n<p>So push, pull, fail, strive, love, grow. Expand and contract. Seek comfort and run in the opposite direction once you possess the very thing you\u2019ve been pursuing. Embrace the paradox that is our life and our world. There is no one path. There is no sense. There is no sober state.<\/p>\n<p>The lens we\u00a0use\u00a0to view reality depends upon both our inner and outer states. This combination is the cocktail of our present moment. Never the same, never to be felt again. This wild ride of the present can only be experienced, it can never be thought into. Feeling is the closest thread we can weave to bringing us some semblance of satisfaction and fullness.<\/p>\n<p>Yet, our emotions are also fleeting. They tell us truer tales of the lives we wish we inhabited. Still, one moment of bliss fades just as fast as the forever night. When the darkness seems overwhelming the light begins to show herself again. We bask in her beauty.<\/p>\n<p>Being free is loving the plate you\u2019ve been given. It\u2019s stepping into the moment that surrounds you, instead of trying to construct a puzzle from the pieces of the past you refuse to put down.<\/p>\n<p>Cultivating gratitude in sorrow. Feeling peace in fleeting happiness.<\/p>\n<p>Liberation is only a moment away. The choice to be free is always available. Nurturing our\u00a0inner states to provide the infinite capacity for freedom is a lifelong practice.<\/p>\n<p>Time to build.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Behind my thoughts lies a sea of pure freedom.
