Living from a place of true freedom of thought. However, this can only come when we begin to shape our own filters.<\/p>\n<p>You\u00a0decide what to\u00a0let into your\u00a0mind. Take control of the stream that&#8217;s coming into your\u00a0life. Fill your life with things that uplift you. Everything else is meaningless noise.<\/p>\n<p>We live in a world that prizes efficiency at all costs. But, what expense are we incurring?<\/p>\n<p>By plugging ourselves into the incessant flow of information we become products of this machine.<\/p>\n<p>Only by conscious removal can we get our freedom back.<\/p>\n<p>Choose the best books you want to read. Unplug from any flow of information you didn&#8217;t take the time to create yourself. It&#8217;s difficult.<\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll face massive resistance, but your freedom is at stake.
