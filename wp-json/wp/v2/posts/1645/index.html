You must always push. Write something that makes you tremble at the thought of hitting publish, make a video that spills your heart onto the screen, or record a song that dives into the depths of your depression. We are all trying to reveal our souls to the world. We are trying to be the most authentic version of ourselves we can possibly be.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Some will hate us and that&#8217;s good.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">If you aren&#8217;t making a rift in your decisions, in your craft, then you aren&#8217;t pushing hard enough. When you have people speaking out against your craft then you&#8217;ve hit the core. What you&#8217;ve done is cause someone to re-examine their own beliefs and start to question themselves. Some accept this, while others take it as an attack and tenaciously dig into you.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Embrace it all, that is all you can do.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">You want to communicate to someone at the deepest level possible, this is the core connection. Say something with your art. Push, and people will push back. Rock the boat.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Go deep with your art. Use your heart as a compass, not the external world. You&#8217;ll get where you want to go if you use the right tool. Have faith and push the boundaries, if not for yourself, for the world.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">We need it, we need you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You have to know deep down you are going to reach your destination.
